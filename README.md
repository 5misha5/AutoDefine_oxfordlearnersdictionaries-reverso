AutoDefine
==========

An add-on to Anki that auto-defines words, optionally adding pronunciation and images. Hit up [ankisrs.net](http://ankisrs.net/) if you're unfamiliar with Anki and spaced repetition systems.

**Note:** We use Merriam-Webster's CollegiateÂ® Dictionary with Audio API to get definitions and pronunciations. This requires you sign up for a Merriam-Webster account and use your own individual API access key. Go to the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary API website](http://www.dictionaryapi.com/), sign up for an account, and request access to the *Collegiate Dictionary*. Then, replace the variable **`MERRIAM_WEBSTER_API_KEY`** with the key you receive.
